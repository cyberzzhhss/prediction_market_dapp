## Prerequisites

   ```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Publish the Smart Contract

Navigate to the `contracts` folder and publish the contract using the SUI CLI:

```bash
sui client publish
```

This will provide you with the package ID and object IDs. Make note of these IDs as they are required in the frontend configuration.

### 2. Configure the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend/src/constants.ts` file.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your published contract and object IDs:

```typescript
export const DEVNET_PACKAGE_ID = "<your-devnet-package-id>";
export const TESTNET_PACKAGE_ID = "<your-testnet-package-id>";
export const MAINNET_PACKAGE_ID = "<your-mainnet-package-id>";

export const DEVNET_DASHBOARD_ID = "<your-devnet-dashboard-id>";
export const TESTNET_DASHBOARD_ID = "<your-testnet-dashboard-id>";
export const MAINNET_DASHBOARD_ID = "<your-mainnet-dashboard-id>";
```

### 3. Install and Run the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
